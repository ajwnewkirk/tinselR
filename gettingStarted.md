### Getting started with Tinsel

Tinsel at its' most basic level is a graphical viewer of newick phylogenetic trees and as a program for producing publication-ready figures.  
The power of Tinsel comes with combining a genetic distance matrix for annotating a tree for outbreak analyses.  

##### Please click on the 'Data Upload' pane, where you will be able to upload your files. 

* **Phylogenetic Tree** - required; a [newick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) generated tree 
* **Genetic Distance data** - optional for use with the annotation function; a tsv/txt/csv file
* **Metadata** - optional for easy correction of tip labels; a tsv/txt/csv file 

<u>Once the phylogenetic tree is uploaded you can -</u>
* Alter additional visualization parameters in the sidebar panel on the left. 

<u>Once the genetic distance file is uploaded you can -</u>
* add annotation to the visual representation of the tree.
